I also acknowledge the risks involved in storing items through a Cubic-facilitated interaction. These include but are not limited to water damage, loss or theft, and damage during moving. I acknowledge that I am participating voluntarily, and that all risks have been made clear to me. <br><br>

By signing below I forfeit all right to bring a suit against Cubic for any reason. I will also make every effort to adhere to the user agreements as listed in writing.  I will ask for clarification when needed. <br><br>

I understand that I cannot store the following items:<br>
Food/perishables <br>
Alcohol or any illegal  <br>
Anything that could constitute a fire hazard (leaky batteries, etc.) <br>
